# Call to 3dttest++
# -prefix: output filename
# -overwrite: overwrite the output file if it exists
# -mask: give the mask file: THIS IS IMPORTANT
# -setA label scanlist: we are labeling this "cbf" but can pick anything, also passing our scan list
# -ClustSim #cores: This is a critical step (but takes a while). Can paralellize by setting #cores (20 here)
## Highly recommend reading the help for this fx to understand ClustSim, but in brief:
## ClustSim uses random permutations of your dataset to simulate the null model for your cluster correction.
## It is super convenient because 1) it does everything for you, and 2) it appends the output to your output .nii.gz file which makes it super easy to visualize your results.
